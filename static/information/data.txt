Model used:hog encoding along with an ml algo
Abstract:As an educational institution, we face the pervasive issue of proxy attendance, which
compromises academic integrity and inefficiently utilizes valuable class time. Our current
manual attendance system is ill-suited to address this problem. To eradicate proxy attendance
and enhance time efficiency, we urgently need an automated attendance system with facial
recognition technology
Real time implementation:
1. Real-time Monitoring: The system provides real-time monitoring and attendance tracking,
allowing you to know who is present and when.
2. Automation: It automates the attendance tracking process, saving time and reducing the need
for manual record-keeping.
3. Accuracy: Facial recognition technology offers high accuracy in identifying individuals,
reducing the chances of unauthorized access or attendance fraud.
4. Alerts and Notifications: The system can send alerts or notifications when unauthorized
individuals are detected, enhancing security.
5. Data Insights: Attendance data collected over time can provide valuable insights into
attendance patterns and trends
Data set- created the required dataset using 2 images and generated 2k images with variations in brightness, contrast and all
